## Getting Started 
Because the project files are too big to upload in blackboard. We package and upload our whole project in Google Drive. Here is the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p7YY0dDuaYvWXM2KHfMDIMYey6L42KcT?usp=sharing
There are two zip files in this link. The playable file’s name is game.zip. The editable file’s name is project7381.zip. 

Our games can be run on any 64-bit Windows system, but may require UE4 tool to be installed on your computer in advance. If you want to paly our game. First, you need to download and unzip the file. If you have installed UE4 in your computer, you can directly open our game by clike the project7381.exe (Path: ..\game\WindowsNoEditor). If you don’t have UE4 tool on your computer, there will be a "UE4 Prerequisites Setup" pop-up box when you open the project7381.exe (Path: ..\game\WindowsNoEditor), you just need to agree to the license and click install. After the installation is complete, you can run the game.
